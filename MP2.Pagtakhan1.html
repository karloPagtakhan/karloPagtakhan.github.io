&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hi there! my name is <font color="orange" size="5">Kai</font> not my real name though. That's the name my friends used to call me.Well my real name is <font color="orange" size="5">Karlo P. Pagtakhan</font>. I grew up at Pasay City and still residing in it at Dasman Residences Apello Cruz,Malibay. I'm studying at Arellano University Jose Abad Santos Campus taking up Bachelor of Science in Information Technology. And at the same time, working at Mcdonald's Makati Avenue as a Service Crew so I can earn for my allowances, tuition fees. Now I know it isn't a joke being a working student. Because after your hard work in your shift you need to get ready for your class. Not to mention the assignment, projects and the dead line!!! Oh, I forgot the examinations, quiz and stuff. Sometimes I never got the time to review my notes, and the outcome is come to worst. But I got a future to look up to, I have no time to let this world wear me out. And I believe it can be done.Just a proper time managing and the determination to never give up, looking ahead in what you really want to be, and of course with the guidance of God. For I believe apart from Him I am nothing. We all know as a man we are limited we are not perfect we get hurt, we get exhausted and sometimes we get angry. In His word I find peace, knowledge and wisdom, in His cross I have seen His love. God never look at us in our flaws but look at us in our heart how we long to make things right. That's why I became also a minister to His church as a musician using the talent that He has given me sharing His love. In my life in what I have now, once only a prayer but by God's grace all became answered. That's why despite of the struggles and the pressure I am striving to finish this race. For I am not alone.

<h2><b>"Education Is The Best Investment"</b></h2></font>

<p style="text-align:justify"> <font face="Dejavu serif" color="yellow" size="4">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Education acts as the key to a successful future to individuals who are serious with it. It provides a financial security and helps a person build a remarkable reputation. Personally, it has helped me to have a competitive edge in the workforce. Through the various skills I have acquired in college, I can work in various companies across the globe. Currently, college education has become the minimum requirement in securing a job in various companies. Education does not only help students to acquire jobs, but also to know how to invest their money in viable businesses. For instance, with the fundamental accounting information, a student will not have to employ an expert to manage his/her business. In addition, with knowledge in accounting, students are able to plan on how to spend their incomes wisely. Like in college education, a person becomes more intelligent as compared to when he/she was just a high school graduate. If a person becomes more intelligent, he/she will have a better-quality life than before. Therefore, with education, a person can acquire various necessities that would have been hard to get if he/she lacked a basic education. Moreover, education helps people to solve problems in an easy way. They also learn how to avoid obvious disagreements with people. As a result, they are able to lead a trouble-free life. Education gives students an opportunity to socialize and make new friends that they could not have met if they were not enrolled in a college. As they interact with new people from different cultures, they learn how to embrace diversity, and remove some stereotypes associated with some cultures. Additionally, in college students can easily advance their careers. For instance, if a student is talented in sports, he/she can participate in various sports and nurture his/her career. vival of human being is inevitable. People do not consider education as the most significant need of today and gives several other obligations more preference and weight age over this very crucial need. The investment made in education is the most productive and everlasting in nature because its tenure and its existence is not compressed and restricted in any time frame and if an individual give investment in education the most beneficial investment in all times.
